# ghaHook

Hooks to GHArcade to improve its lifespan and usability in 2025 and beyond.

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT DOES NOT DO MUCH.**

You will still need a valid authentication dongle to launch the game.

Builds with Visual Studio 2010 using the Visual Studio 2008 toolset to retain
compatibility with Windows XP Embedded.

Currently only works with GHA version 1.37 and later.

Uses [minhook v1.3.2](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook).

## Features

* Launch the game without an I/O board connected

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/ghaHook/releases/latest).
    * The release package comes with [simpledllloader](https://github.com/aap/simpledllloader).
2. Extract the ZIP to the GHArcade game directory. On a cabinet, this is at
   `C:\GH3\DEPLOY\GH3`.
3. Launch GH3.exe.
